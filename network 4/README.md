# Questions and Tasks

## Questions

1. In gRPC, we have to run a command to recognize the proto path and define the types of parameters. In this case, how can I use this in the server?

2. In cache-control, the server sends a header with necessary information for controlling the cache, but what happens if the client sets "disable cache" in the browser settings?

## Tasks

1. Complete the gRPC task with Node.js and Python

2. Complete the task for HTTP headers and cache-control
